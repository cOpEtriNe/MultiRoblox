# MultiRoblox
## What is MultiRoblox?
MultiRoblox is an open-source program that allows you to open multiple instances of ROBLOX!
Open this tool first, then open roblox. From testing, it's possible to have only 1 client open and then open
Multiroblox and let other accounts join afterwards.

Roblox is currently cracking down on multi-instancing stuff so your clients will apparently close after some time. (RIP üôè)

A bunch of people complained on the real repo that it contained a virus on the official release,
I don't know if that's true but they should compile it themselves.
