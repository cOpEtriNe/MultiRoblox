# MultiRoblox
## What is MultiRoblox?
MultiRoblox is an open-source program that allows you to open multiple instances of ROBLOX!

Roblox is currently cracking down on multi-instancing stuff so your clients will apparently close after some time. (RIP üôè)

A bunch of people complained on the real repo that it contained a virus on the official release,
I don't know if that's true but they should compile it themselves.
